# 🔍 Cryptocurrency Transaction Tracing Tool

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a blockchain analytics tool developed for the **Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)** to trace cryptocurrency transactions associated with drug trafficking and other illicit activities. The tool identifies the **end receiver** of crypto funds, providing actionable intelligence to law enforcement agencies.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Cryptocurrencies are inherently **secure and anonymous**, making them ideal for unlawful purposes such as:

- Drug trafficking
- Human trafficking
- Weapons trade
- Online scams
- Terrorist financing

Illicit actors exploit the pseudonymous nature of blockchain to mask financial trails. Traditional tracking methods fail to keep up with the complexity and volume of transactions. Our tool aims to trace the **transaction chain** and identify the **final recipient**, forming the basis for further AI-based investigation in future iterations.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The current version focuses on **transaction flow analysis** to detect and report the **end-chain wallet** of a given transaction path. Future versions will include:

- AI-driven pattern recognition
- Behavioral wallet analysis
- De-anonymization via OSINT and clustering
